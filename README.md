## üõ°Ô∏è CAPTCHA Handling Strategy

The application employs a straightforward approach to handle CAPTCHA challenges:

- It reads the CAPTCHA text directly from the webpage and automatically fills it into the input field.
- Future improvements could include integrating with a CAPTCHA-solving service or exploring alternative methods to enhance user experience.

‚úÖ No image processing or OCR required.

## Sample Case Inputs

You can test with the following real Delhi High Court cases:

| Case Type  | Case Number | Year  |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| W.P.(C)    | 12230       | 2022  |
| CRL.M.C.   | 1784        | 2021  |
| FAO        | 86          | 2019  |
| CS(OS)     | 1729        | 2013  |
| W.P.(CRL)  | 1309        | 2020  |

## Environment Variables

No external environment variables are required at this stage. If future CAPTCHA APIs or deployment steps are added, they may be documented here.
